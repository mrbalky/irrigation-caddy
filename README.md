Simple scripts for automating IrrigationCaddy

The IrrigationCaddy web UI is excellent, but I did miss the "season adjust" feature of my old controller.

I also have an inadequate compressor for blowing out the lines in the fall, so wanted to automate the multiple cycles
required to blow out each zone.

These scripts require BASH and wget.
